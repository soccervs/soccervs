# INTRODUCTION
Recognizing there wasn’t a fast-paced, competitive, multiplayer-focused football game on the market, we decided to change that. Bridging the gap between the real world and the digital, we’re building.

Traditional football games have failed to provide smooth and latency-free gameplay suitable for competitive play, and users have put thousands of hours into these games grinding for assets with no real value. We do not believe that exhaustive gameplay and centralized ownership of assets should be the heading direction for future football games. As revolutionizing as traditional football games once were, it is time for a new era. Users deserve a play-to-earn football game with enjoyable gameplay and full ownership of their assets.

SOCCER VS is a triple-A play-to-earn football game. With SOCCER VS, flawless and competitive gameplay will always be the number one priority. All users will be the rightful owners of their assets, which are earned for free through gameplay. By introducing digital ownership in Soccer Vs, users will at all times be able to sell their assets in an open marketplace for real-life money if desired. Hence, SOCCER VS aims to attract players who want a good gameplay experience, compete in a proper esports football title, and truly own their digital assets.

We are humble in the way we work, embracing that skilled and passionate people are the heart and core of our studio. However, we will never be humble in our objective: creating the best football game in the world. By bridging the gap between the real world and the digital, we are building something more than a game. Our community is the most important voice, and we want to give every gamer a feeling of true ownership. You are included!
