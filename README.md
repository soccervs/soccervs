# INTRODUCTION

Recognizing there wasn’t a fast-paced, competitive, multiplayer-focused football game on the market, we decided to change that. Bridging the gap between the real world and the digital, we’re building.

Traditional football games have failed to provide smooth and latency-free gameplay suitable for competitive play, and users have put thousands of hours into these games grinding for assets with no real value. We do not believe that exhaustive gameplay and centralized ownership of assets should be the heading direction for future football games. As revolutionizing as traditional football games once were, it is time for a new era. Users deserve a play-to-earn football game with enjoyable gameplay and full ownership of their assets.

SOCCER VS is a triple-A play-to-earn football game. With SOCCER VS, flawless and competitive gameplay will always be the number one priority. All users will be the rightful owners of their assets, which are earned for free through gameplay. By introducing digital ownership in Soccer Vs, users will at all times be able to sell their assets in an open marketplace for real-life money if desired. Hence, SOCCER VS aims to attract players who want a good gameplay experience, compete in a proper esports football title, and truly own their digital assets.

We are humble in the way we work, embracing that skilled and passionate people are the heart and core of our studio. However, we will never be humble in our objective: creating the best football game in the world. By bridging the gap between the real world and the digital, we are building something more than a game. Our community is the most important voice, and we want to give every gamer a feeling of true ownership. You are included!

# GAMEPLAY

SOCCER VS will be a fast-paced game that stays true to the sport of football. We believe that this is the best way to achieve a large skill gap in a football game while keeping it fun for anybody to pick up and play. Nevertheless, fully realistic football games come with their challenges, such as poor input responsiveness due to advanced realistic animations. We are creating a proper football game, but where there is a need, the gameplay experience will be prioritized over realism. We will never use any catch-up mechanics, handicaps, or similar features but will instead focus on proper matchmaking to make games engaging. The best gamers should win due to their skills in gameplay and squad management—nothing else.

The mentality at SOCCER VS is multiplayer first. We are going to put a lot of resources into creating a fluid experience online to minimize lag, latency, and button delay, which is a big problem in football games today. The Netcode will be built from scratch with the ambition of providing lag-free gameplay. We will also have a well-distributed infrastructure to enhance the experience in many different geographical areas. The game will run cross-platform, meaning that you will be able to play against opponents on different platforms.

SOCCER VS will be a free-to-play title with full digital ownership. This means that the game is entirely free to enter, and the rewards earned for free in the game are fully owned by the users and can, at any point, be sold in a marketplace for real money if desired. We are not going for a microtransaction business model but will mainly rely on royalties from secondary sales. We believe this is a fair solution for both users and the development team, as users earn rewards for free that they can sell, while the development team can tap into the growth of the ecosystem through royalties. Part of the secondary sales will be distributed to a community treasury, which will be used for tournament/league prize pools and other community rewards.
